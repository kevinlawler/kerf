struct FILE_REGISTRY
{
  // The purpose of this thing is to dedupe files across the process based on
  // path. To do this we reduce them to inodes on devices. Then when they are
  // deduped we keep a simple per-file rwlock counter protected by a global
  // mutex (sutex). The reason for this is primarily that mmap's MAP_SHARED and
  // MAP_PRIVATE cannot live together simultaneously: whether MAP_SHARED edits
  // appear in a separate MAP_PRIVATE is undefined behavior, and typically
  // edits do---this effectively makes reads inconsistent. Basic POSIX read()
  // and write() calls have similar interactions. You do not want to read() a
  // file into a buffer if another thread is altering it with MAP_SHARED, and
  // so on.

  // We disambiguate all files based on the concatenation st_dev:st_ino from
  // stat(). This handles symlinks, hardlinks, and path equivalence.
  // Only regular files go here, not directories (I think).
  // The reference_counter is keyed on st_dev:st_ino pointing to values
  // consisting of read-write counts âˆˆ {-1,0,1,...}. Like a rwlock, -1
  // indicates write-locked, 0 indicates not-in-use, and 1+ indicates the
  // readers count.
  // MAP_SHARED uses the write lock.
  // MAP_PRIVATE increments the read lock.
  // Regular file reads and writes need the corresponding lock (actually the
  // wrapper we've made).
  // "Lock" is a bit of a misnomer here. We don't expect anything to block on
  // reference counts being modified by this class. We expect to expose only
  // "try" methods that return immediately.
  // This functionality differs slightly from a SUTEX:

  // Assumption. You can not open a file via inode (the OS prevents this for
  // security reasons). So we blithely assume the user will not change file
  // links (re: path->inode connections) under us. This is about as good as it
  // can get. We can store the paths, but we can't open via inode, so we have
  // to hope the inode changes aren't obscured from us. (This applies to files
  // we mmap and munmap.) Additionally, files shouldn't be deleted from under
  // us and such, since we must open() and close() them multiple times with
  // MEMORY_MAPPED. We likely safely detect that condition, but anyway, the
  // point stands. For the most part, don't mess with our file tree from
  // outside the process while it's active inside the process, even if in some
  // cases you can get away with rewriting symlinks and such if the inodes
  // don't currently have any locks.

  // Assumption. Some file systems may have exotic race conditions with inode
  // and device id reuse. We ignore all these.

  // Regime. For the write lock we've elected to use "-1" instead of
  // -thread_id, as we do with sutex, since the current thinking is that the
  // encapsulating object owns the file, and the process, but not really the
  // thread. So instead of some kind of weird recursion-safety, threads should
  // know what files they have. If we used -thread_id, you could have things
  // like a thread mapping a file for a write, and then mapping it again for a
  // [thread-safe] sub-write, but this seems exotic and weird: I think we would
  // rather have the thread be aware of what it's doing.

  // Commentary. Instead of using `I` for the map's values, we could use SUTEX.
  // Then instead of a new guard it would let you re-use our SUTEX guards and
  // much of that logic. Ultimately however this is much more awkward since you
  // have introspection into the map's values that short-circuits the main
  // global FILE_REGISTRY sutex. It makes several things harder: you need
  // thread-ignoring sutexes, failure-aware sutexes, try-only sutex guards, and
  // will have trouble keeping the global map lightweight, despite that fact
  // that you get guarantees that insert and erase do not move addresses around
  // (Section 23.1.2#8).
